          <p>Both Hebrew and Arabic alphabets have 24 characters. Please note that some characters should be written differently depending on their position in the word (beginning, middle, end and stand-alone). Sometimes browsers like IE11 and Edge display Arabic text as disjoined characters, it is a bug. </p>

		  <p>Numbers, English names, and citations within the RTL text are written in LTR direction within the text flow. Stand-alone English text may be right-aligned, in general going in a LTR direction. Punctuation is so-called weak characters, and they are placed at the end of the string on the left. In this example, the tester has wrapped part of a HE expression into the LTR tag to overwrite the browser default behavior that was incorrectly rearranging the string word order:</p>

                          Sometimes English text with punctuation may look not very good in RTL layouts. There is no way to control the direction of user-defined text that may be typed in any language. For UI text coded by our developers, it is better to control the punctuation in Always English text like product names. If the developer is not sure how to do it, use LTR tags to prevent browsers from moving punctuation to inappropriate positions.

                        The X and Y coordinates are written in pairs (X, Y) in a mathematical format to represent the x- axis and y-axis. While cartographers write spherical coordinates in reverse order, latitude (Y) is first and then longitude (X). Coincidently, this is the correct reading direction for Arabic users, (Y, X) if you intend to use Y,X to represent that the same location in mathematical format.

                        <em>Note:</em> Not all countries use N/S/E/W notation similar to English. Abbreviations in native characters are widely used in Russia, Thailand, Japan, and many other countries with non-Latin alphabets. Often those abbreviations of hemispheres are followed by abbreviations for latitude and longitude, so more than one character is required for each coordinate notation. Countries where Arabic is used refer to the cardinal directions as Ash Shamaliyah (N), Al Gharbiyah (W), Ash Sharqiyah (E), and Al Janobiyah (S). Additionally, Al Wusta is used for the center. For instance, N is written in AR as ثوانی

		  <summary>Interactive elements moving in right or left direction should follow their direction</summary>
          <p>
                    Examples are vertical separators between windows and right-align and left-align buttons.

                      <figcaption>Here is a bad example when a pointer is moving to one side and a vertical separator is moving to opposite side. Avoid such behavior.</figcaption>

                  <p>
                    Test manually that if a tool has an arrow it moves the element the same direction shown in the icon.
